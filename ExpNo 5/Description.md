## ExpNo 5: Implement Minimax Search Algorithm for a Simple TIC-TAC-TOE game
### Name: Manoj Choudhary v
### Register Number:212221240025
### Aim:
Implement Minimax Search Algorithm for a Simple TIC-TAC-TOE game

### Theory and Procedure:
To begin, let's start by defining what it means to play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe:

If I play perfectly, every time I play I will either win the game, or I will draw the game. Furthermore, if I play against another perfect player, I will always draw the game.

How might we describe these situations quantitatively? Let's assign a score to the "end game conditions:"

- I win, hurray! I get 10 points!
- I lose, shit. I lose 10 points (because the other player gets 10 points)
- I draw, whatever. I get zero points, nobody gets any points.

So now we have a situation where we can determine a possible score for any game end state.

Looking at a Brief Example
To apply this, let's take an example from near the end of a game, where it is my turn. I am X. My goal here, obviously, is to maximize my end game score.

If the top of this image represents the state of the game I see when it is my turn, then I have some choices to make, there are three places I can play, one of which clearly results in me winning and earning the 10 points. If I don't make that move, O could very easily win. And I don't want O to win, so my goal here, as the first player, should be to pick the maximum scoring move.

But What About O?
What do we know about O? Well, we should assume that O is also playing to win this game, but relative to us, the first player, O obviously wants to choose the move that results in the worst score for us, it wants to pick a move that would minimize our ultimate score. Let's look at things from O's perspective, starting with the two other game states from above in which we don't immediately win:

The choice is clear, O would pick any of the moves that result in a score of -10.

### Describing Minimax
The key to the Minimax algorithm is a back and forth between the two players, where the player whose "turn it is" desires to pick the move with the maximum score. In turn, the scores for each of the available moves are determined by the opposing player deciding which of its available moves has the minimum score. And the scores for the opposing player's moves are again determined by the turn-taking player trying to maximize its score and so on all the way down the move tree to an end state.

A description for the algorithm, assuming X is the "turn-taking player," would look something like:

1. If the game is over, return the score from X's perspective.
2. Otherwise get a list of new game states for every possible move.
3. Create a scores list.
4. For each of these states, add the minimax result of that state to the scores list.
5. If it's X's turn, return the maximum score from the scores list.
6. If it's O's turn, return the minimum score from the scores list.

You'll notice that this algorithm is recursive; it flips back and forth between the players until a final score is found.

Let's walk through the algorithm's execution with the full move tree, and show why, algorithmically, the instant winning move will be picked.

## A Coded Version of Minimax
Hopefully by now you have a rough sense of how the minimax algorithm determines the best move to play. Let's examine my implementation of the algorithm to solidify the understanding:

Here is the function for scoring the game:

```ruby
# @player is the turn-taking player
def score(game)
    if game.win?(@player)
        return 10
    elsif game.win?(@opponent)
        return -10
    else
        return 0
    end
end
```

Simple enough, return +10 if the current player wins the game, -10 if the other player wins, and 0 for a draw. You will note that who the player is doesn't matter. X or O is irrelevant, only whose turn it happens to be.

And now the actual minimax algorithm; note that in this implementation a choice or move is simply a row / column address on the board, for example, [0,2] is the top right square on a 3x3 board.

```ruby
def minimax(game)
    return score(game) if game.over?
    scores = [] # an array of scores
    moves = []  # an array of moves

    # Populate the scores array, recursing as needed
    game.get_available_moves.each do |move|
        possible_game = game.get_new_state(move)
        scores.push minimax(possible_game)
        moves.push move
    end

    # Do the min or the max calculation
    if game.active_turn == @player
        # This is the max calculation
        max_score_index = scores.each_with_index.max[1]
        @choice = moves[max_score_index]
        return scores[max_score_index]
    else
        # This is the min calculation
        min_score_index = scores each_with_index min[1]
        @choice = moves[min_score_index]
        return scores[min_score_index]
    end
end
```
